      Getting vaccinated may also reduce your risk of becoming infected and possibly developing post-COVID-19 condition. If you do become infected, being vaccinated also reduces the likelihood of developing symptoms of post COVID-19 condition compared to people who haven't received a COVID-19 vaccine.
      Post COVID-19 condition, also known as long COVID, is when people still experience symptoms of COVID-19 for weeks or months after their initial infection.`

      If you haven't received any COVID-19 vaccines before, the updated COVID-19 vaccine can be used for your vaccinations.

      helps improve the immune response
      provides better and longer-lasting protection
